## Getting Started

This is my first portfolio piece. It is not as put together as I would have hoped, but that is because I spent most of my time trying to look ahead and integrate new and cool concepts in my html and CSS. As evident by the look of the website, I could not fully grasp all of those new concepts. I will regularly update this website to showcase my growth and improvement. 

I believe I was able to successfully meet all of the acceptance criteria.
